<div class="slide" id="what is ansible">

<!--
-x- Compared to most similar tools, ansible is quite young.
-x- I started applying it in earnest about a year ago, and
-x- can happily report that the rough edges are now pretty
-x- well smoothed.
-x-
-x- Here's a few things that set ansible apart.
-x-
-x- It just needs ssh and python.
-x-
-x- It's agentless, so you push rather than pull.
-x- Among other things, that means you don't have to
-x- worry about all the puppet daemons hitting your repo
-x- all at once.
-x-
-x- You tell it the desired states in yaml.
