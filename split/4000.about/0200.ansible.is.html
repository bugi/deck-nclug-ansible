<!--
-x- Ansible is a tool for automating
-x- deployment, configuration and orchestration.
-x-
-x- One thing ansible does well I think compared to
-x- other tools is that it will build systems for you.
-x-
-x- I looked recently on puppet's website and found that
-x- it would talk to AWS and VMWare.  But that was it.
-x- Hopefully I just can't read their documentation very well.
-x-
-x- Speaking of which, I find ansible's documentation much
-x- easier to understand than what I found last time I
-x- used puppet in anger.  And don't get me started on chef's.
-x-
-x- But with ansible, building the hosts can be just as
-x- automated as configuring hosts once they exist.
-x-
-x- Orchestration is important.  I'll get back to that.
