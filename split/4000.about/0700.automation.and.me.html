-x- We're just about to get to the examples.
-x-
-x- But I wouldn't want to leave you with the idea that
-x- I'm poking at puppet and others blindly.  Now, it has
-x- been long enough that I wouldn't remember great
-x- detail about any of these others without a bit
-x- of reimmersion, but:
-x-
-x- I have used puppet in anger.
-x- I used salt in rebellion.
-x- I tried salt on sufferance.
-x- I fiddled around with rex briefly.
-x- I did manage to avoid cfengine,
-x- which is probably why I wrote my own
-x- automation tools a few times.
-x-
-x- And ansible is far and away the best automation tool I've used.
-x-
-x-
-x-
-x- Oh and by the way, I hear the local python meetup is
-x- planning a deathmatch between ansible and salt.
-x- It looks like Sean will be the ansible partisan.
